# Profile-Updated

The goal of this challenge was to create a working portfolio displaying current projects. All images used were taken by me. I own a 3D printer, I created the render of Atlas, I printed out the pieces of the arm, and the last image is of a beat I was making. There is only one more component that needs to come in before the prosthetic arm can be put together. For those interested in the arm, the one displayed is: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1691704. Although I made slight size modifications to allow a better grip, the concept is still the same. Most 3d printed arms are very similar in design and components. Interactive links will be added at a later date. My overall goal is to create a portfolio page that will contain my 3D, music, and circuit based projects.
